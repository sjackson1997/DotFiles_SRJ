# DotFiles_SRJ
Repository to hold my various configuration files to share across machines

## What this is...
Clearly based on commits, I'm not doing a lot here, but I do work with Linux in my off time and I'm (slowly) learning to use Git and GitHub for version control.  These files are what I'm using for installing vim on a new Ubuntu install, and my other dot files related to my Linux use.  Not a lot here, but if you read this, you are welcome to use what you see here, and I'd even welcome suggestions to changes (git pull requests?  I've never done one!  You could be the first!). 

When we get out of this COVID-19 pandemic, I'm hopeful that the NorthEast Pennsylvania Linux Users Group (NEPA LUGgers) will be getting back together, and we may at some point discuss these files in a meeting.
